## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot.jpg">

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ling/index) of the University of Potsdam and a member of the [Potsdam Morpho-Syntax Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/potsdam-msl/home). 

I got my PhD from MIT in 2023.

My main research interests are in syntax and morphology⁠.

## My full name

It's pronounced [stanizˈlao dzomˈpi] and spelled with a grave accent on the final *i*. (I myself have been inconsistent in this regard; now I'm trying to fix that.)

## Updates

* I will be at [NELS 55](https://campuspress.yale.edu/nels55/) in October to present [Luke Adamson](https://lukejamesadamson.wixsite.com/linguistics)'s and my joint work on the PCC and polite pronouns.

* [Zhouyi Sun](https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/szy/) and I were at [WCCFL 42](https://www.wccfl42.com/home) to present our joint work about (\*)ABA effects in multidimensional paradigms.
